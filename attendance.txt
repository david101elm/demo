Our company values punctuality, reliability, and accountability in the workplace and has established clear attendance policies to ensure smooth operations and optimal productivity. All employees are expected to adhere to their designated work schedules and arrive on time for their shifts. In the event of tardiness or unexpected absence, employees are required to notify their immediate supervisor or the HR department as soon as possible. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness without valid reasons may result in disciplinary action, including verbal warnings, written warnings, and ultimately, termination of employment. However, we understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, and employees may require time off for personal or medical reasons. In such cases, employees are encouraged to utilize available paid time off or discuss alternative arrangements with their supervisor or HR. Our attendance policy aims to promote a culture of accountability, professionalism, and reliability among employees while providing flexibility and support when needed.
