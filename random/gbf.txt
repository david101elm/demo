The Great Barrier Reef, stretching over 2,300 kilometers along the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the largest coral reef system on Earth. Teeming with vibrant marine life and breathtaking coral formations, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a natural wonder of the world. However, this ecological marvel faces threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing, endangering its delicate ecosystem. Conservation efforts are underway to preserve this underwater treasure for future generations to marvel at and enjoy.
