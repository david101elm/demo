The Northern Lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, paint the Arctic skies with mesmerizing colors. These celestial displays occur when charged particles from the sun collide with atoms in the Earth's atmosphere, creating a spectacle of dancing lights. Watching the auroras sway and shimmer across the darkness of the night is an awe-inspiring experience, drawing travelers from around the world to witness nature's own light show.
