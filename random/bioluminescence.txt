Bioluminescence, the ability of living organisms to produce light through chemical reactions, illuminates the darkness of the ocean depths and tropical forests with otherworldly beauty. From glowing jellyfish to luminous fungi, bioluminescent organisms captivate scientists and nature enthusiasts alike. This natural phenomenon serves various purposes, from attracting mates to deterring predators and luring prey. Studying bioluminescence sheds light on the diversity of life on Earth and inspires technological innovations in fields such as medicine and conservation.
