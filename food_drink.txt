Our company encourages a positive and respectful workplace environment, including in matters relating to food and drink consumption. Employees are welcome to bring their own food and beverages to consume during designated break times or in designated areas such as the break room or designated eating areas. Alcoholic beverages are strictly prohibited during work hours unless specifically authorized for company-sponsored events. Employees are responsible for cleaning up after themselves and disposing of any food waste or containers appropriately. To ensure a pleasant environment for all, strong-smelling or messy foods that may cause disruptions or discomfort to others should be consumed discreetly or avoided altogether. Additionally, we promote hydration and provide access to water stations or other beverages to help employees stay refreshed and focused throughout the workday. This policy aims to foster a harmonious and considerate workplace culture while supporting employees' nutritional needs and preferences.
