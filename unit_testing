At our company, we prioritize the implementation of robust unit testing practices to ensure the reliability and stability of our software products. Unit testing is mandatory for all code changes and should cover critical functionalities and edge cases. Developers are responsible for writing unit tests alongside their code, adhering to a minimum code coverage threshold of 80%. Before merging code into the main branch, all unit tests must pass successfully. Continuous integration pipelines automatically run unit tests on every code commit, providing rapid feedback to developers. Additionally, developers are encouraged to refactor and improve existing unit tests as part of their ongoing development process. This rigorous unit testing policy aims to minimize bugs, enhance code maintainability, and ultimately deliver high-quality software products to our customers.
