Welcome to the Company API documentation, providing access to company resources and services. Authentication using an API key is required for all requests, which should be included in the header. The base URL is https://api.company.com/v1. Endpoints include /employees, /departments, /projects, and /tasks for CRUD operations on respective resources. Request parameters include query parameters for filtering and pagination, and request bodies should be in JSON format for creating or updating resources. Responses are in JSON format, and errors are handled with appropriate HTTP status codes. Rate limiting is enforced for fair usage. For further assistance, contact support@company.com. Happy coding!
