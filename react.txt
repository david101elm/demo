Our company website's frontend is developed using React, a JavaScript library known for its component-based architecture, facilitating modular development and code reusability. We design reusable components to encapsulate UI elements and functionalities, composing them to construct complex interfaces across different pages and sections. React Router ensures smooth client-side routing, while Redux manages state efficiently, ensuring predictable state changes. We integrate with third-party libraries and APIs for enhanced functionality and follow best practices, including responsive design and thorough testing with tools like Jest and Enzyme. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines automate the build and deployment process, enabling rapid iteration and delivery of new features and updates. This documentation provides insights into our frontend development approach, guiding developers to build a robust and engaging user experience using React.
