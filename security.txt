Subject: Inquiry Regarding Workplace Security Policy

Dear Johnathan,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about our company's workplace security policy. With recent developments in cybersecurity threats and physical security concerns, I believe it's crucial for us to ensure that our policies and protocols are up-to-date and effectively safeguarding our employees, data, and assets. Could you please provide me with an overview of our current security measures and any updates or initiatives planned to enhance our security posture? Additionally, I am interested in any training opportunities or resources available to employees to increase awareness and preparedness regarding security best practices. Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Best regards,
Emily Mach
